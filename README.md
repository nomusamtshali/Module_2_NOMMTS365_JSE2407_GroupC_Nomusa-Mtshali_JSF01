[JSF01] Project: Alpine Challenge

# Project Overview

For the project 'JSF01', I was tasked with using the starter code from the CodeSpace-Academy repo in order to refactor into an Alpine.js based project. The repo included an e-commerce store which uses an api to fetch all the data that is displayed in the store, the store was a React based project that included all the accompanying components to build out the e-commerce store. I had to use my new-found knowledge to accomplish this brief and find a way to complete the brief.

# Project Brief

- Study and understand the Alpine e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.
- Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.
- Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.
- Code your solution in Alpine.js and document your code with JSDoc.
- Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_2_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF01)
- Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set up the project, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric
- Test your application for any bugs and improvements.
- Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository
- Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF01 Submission Project Tab.

# Technologies Used

- Alpine.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework used for building the e-commerce store.
- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.
- Fake Store API: A RESTful API used to fetch data for the e-commerce store.
- HTML: Used for structuring the application's UI components.
- JavaScript: Used for writing the application's logic and interacting with the Fake Store API.

# Elements included

- React project refactored into the Alpine.js based e-commerce project
- TailwindCSS styling

# Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>.
2. Open the project: Open the project folder in your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Start the live server: Open the index.html file with a live server, such as live-server or http-server. This will start the application in your default web browser.

# Usage Examples

- Browse products: You can navigate to the application's homepage to browse available products.
- View product details: You can click on a product to view its details, including price, description, and reviews.
- Filter categories: You can filter through the different categories in the dropdown.
- Sort products: You can sort the product's prices from low to high, high to low or set it to default.

# Reflections

### Areas of mastery

- Learned a lot but there was no area of mastery for this project

### Challenges faced

- The main challenges I faced was dealing with aesthetics of the Alpine code structure and having to code the project script in shorthand all in the html file.

- Another random challenge I faced was dealing which version of the project I was dealing with as I had created several repositories while building the project and keeping up with them became a bit of a problem along the way.

### Areas of Improvement

- Alpine.js skills: I would like to improve my understanding and skills in using Alpine.js to build more complex projects in the future.

# Overall learning experience

- Working on this project was a valuable learning experience. I gained hands-on experience with Alpine.js and learned how to refactor an existing project to use a new framework. I also improved my problem-solving skills and learned to navigate the challenges of working with a new technology. Overall, this project helped me to grow as a developer and prepared me for future projects that require adaptability and creativity.
